  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by trying to concentrate fully and get distracted by nobody and trying to put my hand up as much as possible, which didn't really happen because I was quite confused a lot of the time.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Not too sure. I got distracted a bit but that barely loosened my concentration. The lesson was going quite quickly so I wasn’t able to keep up 100 percent.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try keep up properly and if I’m confused again, I should just ask questions about anything I’m not sure on.</td>
